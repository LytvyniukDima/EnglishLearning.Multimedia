	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio.

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

O, farewell, honest soldier. \nWho hath reliev'd you?\n \nFrancisco. Bernardo hath my place. Give you good night. Exit.\n \nMarcellus. Holla, Bernardo!\n \nBernardo. Say- \nWhat, is Horatio there ?\n \nHoratio. A piece of him.\n \nBernardo. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.\n \nMarcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?\n \nBernardo. I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, \nAnd will not let belief take hold of him \nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us. \nTherefore I have entreated him along,\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night, \nThat, if again this apparition come, \nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\n \nHoratio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!\n \nBernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.\n \nMarcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\n \nBernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night \nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark \nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!\n \nMarcellus.

Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

Well, good night. \nIf you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, \nThe rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n \nFrancisco. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?\n \nHoratio. Friends to this ground.\n \nMarcellus. And liegemen to the Dane.\n \nFrancisco. Give you good night.\n \nMarcellus. O, farewell, honest soldier. \nWho hath reliev'd you?\n \nFrancisco. Bernardo hath my place. Give you good night. Exit.\n \nMarcellus. Holla, Bernardo!\n \nBernardo. Say- \nWhat, is Horatio there ?\n \nHoratio. A piece of him.\n \nBernardo. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.\n \nMarcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?\n \nBernardo. I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, \nAnd will not let belief take hold of him \nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us. \nTherefore I have entreated him along,\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night, \nThat, if again this apparition come, \nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\n \nHoratio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!\n \nBernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.\n \nMarcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\n \nBernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night \nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark \nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!\n \nMarcellus.

Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!\n \nBernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.\n \nMarcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\n \nBernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night \nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark \nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!\n \nMarcellus. It is offended.\n \nBernardo. See, it stalks away!\n \nHoratio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!\n \nExit Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.\n \nBernardo. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale. \nIs not this something more than fantasy? \nWhat think you on't?\n \nHoratio. Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus.

Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

'Tis bitter cold, \nAnd I am sick at heart.\n \nBernardo. Have you had quiet guard?\n \nFrancisco. Not a mouse stirring.\n \nBernardo. Well, good night. \nIf you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, \nThe rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n \nFrancisco. I think I hear them. Stand, ho!

O, farewell, honest soldier. \nWho hath reliev'd you?\n \nFrancisco. Bernardo hath my place. Give you good night. Exit.\n \nMarcellus. Holla, Bernardo!\n \nBernardo. Say- \nWhat, is Horatio there ?\n \nHoratio. A piece of him.\n \nBernardo. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.\n \nMarcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?\n \nBernardo. I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, \nAnd will not let belief take hold of him \nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us. \nTherefore I have entreated him along,\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night, \nThat, if again this apparition come, \nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\n \nHoratio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus.

Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio.

Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

You come most carefully upon your hour.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.\n \nFrancisco. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold, \nAnd I am sick at heart.\n \nBernardo. Have you had quiet guard?\n \nFrancisco. Not a mouse stirring.\n \nBernardo. Well, good night. \nIf you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, \nThe rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n \nFrancisco. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?\n \nHoratio. Friends to this ground.\n \nMarcellus. And liegemen to the Dane.\n \nFrancisco. Give you good night.\n \nMarcellus. O, farewell, honest soldier. \nWho hath reliev'd you?\n \nFrancisco. Bernardo hath my place. Give you good night. Exit.\n \nMarcellus. Holla, Bernardo!\n \nBernardo. Say- \nWhat, is Horatio there ?\n \nHoratio. A piece of him.\n \nBernardo. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.\n \nMarcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?\n \nBernardo. I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, \nAnd will not let belief take hold of him \nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us. \nTherefore I have entreated him along,\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night, \nThat, if again this apparition come, \nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\n \nHoratio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!\n \nBernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.\n \nMarcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\n \nBernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night \nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark \nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!\n \nMarcellus. It is offended.\n \nBernardo. See, it stalks away!\n \nHoratio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!\n \nExit Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.\n \nBernardo. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale. \nIs not this something more than fantasy? \nWhat think you on't?\n \nHoratio. Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

'Tis bitter cold, \nAnd I am sick at heart.\n \nBernardo. Have you had quiet guard?\n \nFrancisco. Not a mouse stirring.\n \nBernardo. Well, good night. \nIf you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, \nThe rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n \nFrancisco. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?\n \nHoratio. Friends to this ground.\n \nMarcellus. And liegemen to the Dane.\n \nFrancisco. Give you good night.\n \nMarcellus. O, farewell, honest soldier. \nWho hath reliev'd you?\n \nFrancisco. Bernardo hath my place. Give you good night. Exit.\n \nMarcellus. Holla, Bernardo!\n \nBernardo. Say- \nWhat, is Horatio there ?\n \nHoratio. A piece of him.\n \nBernardo. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.\n \nMarcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?\n \nBernardo. I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, \nAnd will not let belief take hold of him \nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us. \nTherefore I have entreated him along,\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night, \nThat, if again this apparition come, \nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\n \nHoratio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!\n \nBernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.\n \nMarcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\n \nBernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night \nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark \nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!\n \nMarcellus. It is offended.\n \nBernardo. See, it stalks away!\n \nHoratio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!\n \nExit Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.\n \nBernardo. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale. \nIs not this something more than fantasy? \nWhat think you on't?\n \nHoratio. Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

'Tis bitter cold, \nAnd I am sick at heart.\n \nBernardo. Have you had quiet guard?\n \nFrancisco. Not a mouse stirring.\n \nBernardo. Well, good night. \nIf you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, \nThe rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n \nFrancisco. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?\n \nHoratio. Friends to this ground.\n \nMarcellus. And liegemen to the Dane.\n \nFrancisco. Give you good night.\n \nMarcellus. O, farewell, honest soldier. \nWho hath reliev'd you?\n \nFrancisco. Bernardo hath my place. Give you good night. Exit.\n \nMarcellus. Holla, Bernardo!\n \nBernardo. Say- \nWhat, is Horatio there ?\n \nHoratio. A piece of him.\n \nBernardo. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.\n \nMarcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?\n \nBernardo. I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, \nAnd will not let belief take hold of him \nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us. \nTherefore I have entreated him along,\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night, \nThat, if again this apparition come, \nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\n \nHoratio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!\n \nBernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.\n \nMarcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\n \nBernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night \nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark \nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!\n \nMarcellus. It is offended.\n \nBernardo. See, it stalks away!\n \nHoratio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!\n \nExit Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.\n \nBernardo. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale. \nIs not this something more than fantasy? \nWhat think you on't?\n \nHoratio. Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!\n \nBernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.\n \nMarcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\n \nBernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night \nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark \nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!\n \nMarcellus. It is offended.\n \nBernardo. See, it stalks away!\n \nHoratio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!\n \nExit Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.\n \nBernardo. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale. \nIs not this something more than fantasy? \nWhat think you on't?\n \nHoratio. Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus.

Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

'Tis bitter cold, \nAnd I am sick at heart.\n \nBernardo. Have you had quiet guard?\n \nFrancisco. Not a mouse stirring.\n \nBernardo. Well, good night. \nIf you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, \nThe rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n \nFrancisco. I think I hear them. Stand, ho!

O, farewell, honest soldier. \nWho hath reliev'd you?\n \nFrancisco. Bernardo hath my place. Give you good night. Exit.\n \nMarcellus. Holla, Bernardo!\n \nBernardo. Say- \nWhat, is Horatio there ?\n \nHoratio. A piece of him.\n \nBernardo. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.\n \nMarcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?\n \nBernardo. I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, \nAnd will not let belief take hold of him \nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us. \nTherefore I have entreated him along,\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night, \nThat, if again this apparition come, \nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\n \nHoratio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus.

Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio.

Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

You come most carefully upon your hour.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.\n \nFrancisco. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold, \nAnd I am sick at heart.\n \nBernardo. Have you had quiet guard?\n \nFrancisco. Not a mouse stirring.\n \nBernardo. Well, good night. \nIf you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, \nThe rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n \nFrancisco. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?\n \nHoratio. Friends to this ground.\n \nMarcellus. And liegemen to the Dane.\n \nFrancisco. Give you good night.\n \nMarcellus. O, farewell, honest soldier. \nWho hath reliev'd you?\n \nFrancisco. Bernardo hath my place. Give you good night. Exit.\n \nMarcellus. Holla, Bernardo!\n \nBernardo. Say- \nWhat, is Horatio there ?\n \nHoratio. A piece of him.\n \nBernardo. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.\n \nMarcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?\n \nBernardo. I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, \nAnd will not let belief take hold of him \nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us. \nTherefore I have entreated him along,\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night, \nThat, if again this apparition come, \nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\n \nHoratio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!\n \nBernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.\n \nMarcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\n \nBernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night \nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark \nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!\n \nMarcellus. It is offended.\n \nBernardo. See, it stalks away!\n \nHoratio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!\n \nExit Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.\n \nBernardo. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale. \nIs not this something more than fantasy? \nWhat think you on't?\n \nHoratio. Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

'Tis bitter cold, \nAnd I am sick at heart.\n \nBernardo. Have you had quiet guard?\n \nFrancisco. Not a mouse stirring.\n \nBernardo. Well, good night. \nIf you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, \nThe rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n \nFrancisco. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?\n \nHoratio. Friends to this ground.\n \nMarcellus. And liegemen to the Dane.\n \nFrancisco. Give you good night.\n \nMarcellus. O, farewell, honest soldier. \nWho hath reliev'd you?\n \nFrancisco. Bernardo hath my place. Give you good night. Exit.\n \nMarcellus. Holla, Bernardo!\n \nBernardo. Say- \nWhat, is Horatio there ?\n \nHoratio. A piece of him.\n \nBernardo. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.\n \nMarcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?\n \nBernardo. I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, \nAnd will not let belief take hold of him \nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us. \nTherefore I have entreated him along,\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night, \nThat, if again this apparition come, \nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\n \nHoratio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!\n \nBernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.\n \nMarcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\n \nBernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night \nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark \nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!\n \nMarcellus. It is offended.\n \nBernardo. See, it stalks away!\n \nHoratio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!\n \nExit Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.\n \nBernardo. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale. \nIs not this something more than fantasy? \nWhat think you on't?\n \nHoratio. Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

'Tis bitter cold, \nAnd I am sick at heart.\n \nBernardo. Have you had quiet guard?\n \nFrancisco. Not a mouse stirring.\n \nBernardo. Well, good night. \nIf you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, \nThe rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n \nFrancisco. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?\n \nHoratio. Friends to this ground.\n \nMarcellus. And liegemen to the Dane.\n \nFrancisco. Give you good night.\n \nMarcellus. O, farewell, honest soldier. \nWho hath reliev'd you?\n \nFrancisco. Bernardo hath my place. Give you good night. Exit.\n \nMarcellus. Holla, Bernardo!\n \nBernardo. Say- \nWhat, is Horatio there ?\n \nHoratio. A piece of him.\n \nBernardo. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.\n \nMarcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?\n \nBernardo. I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, \nAnd will not let belief take hold of him \nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us. \nTherefore I have entreated him along,\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night, \nThat, if again this apparition come, \nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\n \nHoratio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!\n \nBernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.\n \nMarcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\n \nBernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night \nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark \nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!\n \nMarcellus. It is offended.\n \nBernardo. See, it stalks away!\n \nHoratio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!\n \nExit Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.\n \nBernardo. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale. \nIs not this something more than fantasy? \nWhat think you on't?\n \nHoratio. Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!\n \nBernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.\n \nMarcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\n \nBernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night \nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark \nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!\n \nMarcellus. It is offended.\n \nBernardo. See, it stalks away!\n \nHoratio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!\n \nExit Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.\n \nBernardo. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale. \nIs not this something more than fantasy? \nWhat think you on't?\n \nHoratio. Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus.

Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

'Tis bitter cold, \nAnd I am sick at heart.\n \nBernardo. Have you had quiet guard?\n \nFrancisco. Not a mouse stirring.\n \nBernardo. Well, good night. \nIf you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, \nThe rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n \nFrancisco. I think I hear them. Stand, ho!

O, farewell, honest soldier. \nWho hath reliev'd you?\n \nFrancisco. Bernardo hath my place. Give you good night. Exit.\n \nMarcellus. Holla, Bernardo!\n \nBernardo. Say- \nWhat, is Horatio there ?\n \nHoratio. A piece of him.\n \nBernardo. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.\n \nMarcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?\n \nBernardo. I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, \nAnd will not let belief take hold of him \nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us. \nTherefore I have entreated him along,\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night, \nThat, if again this apparition come, \nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\n \nHoratio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus.

Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio.

Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

You come most carefully upon your hour.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.\n \nFrancisco. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold, \nAnd I am sick at heart.\n \nBernardo. Have you had quiet guard?\n \nFrancisco. Not a mouse stirring.\n \nBernardo. Well, good night. \nIf you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, \nThe rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n \nFrancisco. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?\n \nHoratio. Friends to this ground.\n \nMarcellus. And liegemen to the Dane.\n \nFrancisco. Give you good night.\n \nMarcellus. O, farewell, honest soldier. \nWho hath reliev'd you?\n \nFrancisco. Bernardo hath my place. Give you good night. Exit.\n \nMarcellus. Holla, Bernardo!\n \nBernardo. Say- \nWhat, is Horatio there ?\n \nHoratio. A piece of him.\n \nBernardo. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.\n \nMarcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?\n \nBernardo. I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, \nAnd will not let belief take hold of him \nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us. \nTherefore I have entreated him along,\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night, \nThat, if again this apparition come, \nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\n \nHoratio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!\n \nBernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.\n \nMarcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\n \nBernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night \nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark \nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!\n \nMarcellus. It is offended.\n \nBernardo. See, it stalks away!\n \nHoratio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!\n \nExit Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.\n \nBernardo. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale. \nIs not this something more than fantasy? \nWhat think you on't?\n \nHoratio. Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

'Tis bitter cold, \nAnd I am sick at heart.\n \nBernardo. Have you had quiet guard?\n \nFrancisco. Not a mouse stirring.\n \nBernardo. Well, good night. \nIf you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, \nThe rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n \nFrancisco. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?\n \nHoratio. Friends to this ground.\n \nMarcellus. And liegemen to the Dane.\n \nFrancisco. Give you good night.\n \nMarcellus. O, farewell, honest soldier. \nWho hath reliev'd you?\n \nFrancisco. Bernardo hath my place. Give you good night. Exit.\n \nMarcellus. Holla, Bernardo!\n \nBernardo. Say- \nWhat, is Horatio there ?\n \nHoratio. A piece of him.\n \nBernardo. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.\n \nMarcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?\n \nBernardo. I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, \nAnd will not let belief take hold of him \nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us. \nTherefore I have entreated him along,\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night, \nThat, if again this apparition come, \nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\n \nHoratio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!\n \nBernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.\n \nMarcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\n \nBernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night \nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark \nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!\n \nMarcellus. It is offended.\n \nBernardo. See, it stalks away!\n \nHoratio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!\n \nExit Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.\n \nBernardo. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale. \nIs not this something more than fantasy? \nWhat think you on't?\n \nHoratio. Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

'Tis bitter cold, \nAnd I am sick at heart.\n \nBernardo. Have you had quiet guard?\n \nFrancisco. Not a mouse stirring.\n \nBernardo. Well, good night. \nIf you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, \nThe rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n \nFrancisco. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?\n \nHoratio. Friends to this ground.\n \nMarcellus. And liegemen to the Dane.\n \nFrancisco. Give you good night.\n \nMarcellus. O, farewell, honest soldier. \nWho hath reliev'd you?\n \nFrancisco. Bernardo hath my place. Give you good night. Exit.\n \nMarcellus. Holla, Bernardo!\n \nBernardo. Say- \nWhat, is Horatio there ?\n \nHoratio. A piece of him.\n \nBernardo. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.\n \nMarcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?\n \nBernardo. I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, \nAnd will not let belief take hold of him \nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us. \nTherefore I have entreated him along,\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night, \nThat, if again this apparition come, \nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\n \nHoratio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!\n \nBernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.\n \nMarcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\n \nBernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night \nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark \nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!\n \nMarcellus. It is offended.\n \nBernardo. See, it stalks away!\n \nHoratio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!\n \nExit Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.\n \nBernardo. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale. \nIs not this something more than fantasy? \nWhat think you on't?\n \nHoratio. Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!\n \nBernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.\n \nMarcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\n \nBernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night \nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark \nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!\n \nMarcellus. It is offended.\n \nBernardo. See, it stalks away!\n \nHoratio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!\n \nExit Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.\n \nBernardo. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale. \nIs not this something more than fantasy? \nWhat think you on't?\n \nHoratio. Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus.

Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

'Tis bitter cold, \nAnd I am sick at heart.\n \nBernardo. Have you had quiet guard?\n \nFrancisco. Not a mouse stirring.\n \nBernardo. Well, good night. \nIf you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, \nThe rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n \nFrancisco. I think I hear them. Stand, ho!

O, farewell, honest soldier. \nWho hath reliev'd you?\n \nFrancisco. Bernardo hath my place. Give you good night. Exit.\n \nMarcellus. Holla, Bernardo!\n \nBernardo. Say- \nWhat, is Horatio there ?\n \nHoratio. A piece of him.\n \nBernardo. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.\n \nMarcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?\n \nBernardo. I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, \nAnd will not let belief take hold of him \nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us. \nTherefore I have entreated him along,\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night, \nThat, if again this apparition come, \nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\n \nHoratio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus.

Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio.

Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

You come most carefully upon your hour.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.\n \nFrancisco. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold, \nAnd I am sick at heart.\n \nBernardo. Have you had quiet guard?\n \nFrancisco. Not a mouse stirring.\n \nBernardo. Well, good night. \nIf you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, \nThe rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n \nFrancisco. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?\n \nHoratio. Friends to this ground.\n \nMarcellus. And liegemen to the Dane.\n \nFrancisco. Give you good night.\n \nMarcellus. O, farewell, honest soldier. \nWho hath reliev'd you?\n \nFrancisco. Bernardo hath my place. Give you good night. Exit.\n \nMarcellus. Holla, Bernardo!\n \nBernardo. Say- \nWhat, is Horatio there ?\n \nHoratio. A piece of him.\n \nBernardo. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.\n \nMarcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?\n \nBernardo. I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, \nAnd will not let belief take hold of him \nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us. \nTherefore I have entreated him along,\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night, \nThat, if again this apparition come, \nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\n \nHoratio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!\n \nBernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.\n \nMarcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\n \nBernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night \nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark \nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!\n \nMarcellus. It is offended.\n \nBernardo. See, it stalks away!\n \nHoratio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!\n \nExit Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.\n \nBernardo. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale. \nIs not this something more than fantasy? \nWhat think you on't?\n \nHoratio. Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

'Tis bitter cold, \nAnd I am sick at heart.\n \nBernardo. Have you had quiet guard?\n \nFrancisco. Not a mouse stirring.\n \nBernardo. Well, good night. \nIf you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, \nThe rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n \nFrancisco. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?\n \nHoratio. Friends to this ground.\n \nMarcellus. And liegemen to the Dane.\n \nFrancisco. Give you good night.\n \nMarcellus. O, farewell, honest soldier. \nWho hath reliev'd you?\n \nFrancisco. Bernardo hath my place. Give you good night. Exit.\n \nMarcellus. Holla, Bernardo!\n \nBernardo. Say- \nWhat, is Horatio there ?\n \nHoratio. A piece of him.\n \nBernardo. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.\n \nMarcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?\n \nBernardo. I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, \nAnd will not let belief take hold of him \nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us. \nTherefore I have entreated him along,\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night, \nThat, if again this apparition come, \nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\n \nHoratio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!\n \nBernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.\n \nMarcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\n \nBernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night \nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark \nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!\n \nMarcellus. It is offended.\n \nBernardo. See, it stalks away!\n \nHoratio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!\n \nExit Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.\n \nBernardo. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale. \nIs not this something more than fantasy? \nWhat think you on't?\n \nHoratio. Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

You come most carefully upon your hour.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.\n \nFrancisco. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold, \nAnd I am sick at heart.\n \nBernardo. Have you had quiet guard?\n \nFrancisco. Not a mouse stirring.\n \nBernardo. Well, good night. \nIf you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, \nThe rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n \nFrancisco. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?\n \nHoratio. Friends to this ground.\n \nMarcellus. And liegemen to the Dane.\n \nFrancisco. Give you good night.\n \nMarcellus. O, farewell, honest soldier. \nWho hath reliev'd you?\n \nFrancisco. Bernardo hath my place. Give you good night. Exit.\n \nMarcellus. Holla, Bernardo!\n \nBernardo. Say- \nWhat, is Horatio there ?\n \nHoratio. A piece of him.\n \nBernardo. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.\n \nMarcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?\n \nBernardo. I have seen nothing.\n \nMarcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, \nAnd will not let belief take hold of him \nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us. \nTherefore I have entreated him along,\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night, \nThat, if again this apparition come, \nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\n \nHoratio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!\n \nBernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.\n \nMarcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\n \nBernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night \nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark \nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!\n \nMarcellus. It is offended.\n \nBernardo. See, it stalks away!\n \nHoratio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!\n \nExit Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.\n \nBernardo. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale. \nIs not this something more than fantasy? \nWhat think you on't?\n \nHoratio. Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio.

Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio.

Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n \nBernardo. Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears, \nThat are so fortified against our story, \nWhat we two nights have seen.\n \nHoratio. Well, sit we down, \nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\n \nBernardo. Last night of all, \nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole \nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself, \nThe bell then beating one-\n \nEnter Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!\n \nBernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.\n \nMarcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\n \nBernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n \nBernardo. It would be spoke to.\n \nMarcellus. Question it, Horatio.\n \nHoratio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night \nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark \nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!\n \nMarcellus. It is offended.\n \nBernardo. See, it stalks away!\n \nHoratio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!\n \nExit Ghost.\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.\n \nBernardo. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale. \nIs not this something more than fantasy? \nWhat think you on't?\n \nHoratio. Before my God, I might not this believe \nWithout the sensible and true avouch \nOf mine own eyes.\n \nMarcellus. Is it not like the King?\n \nHoratio. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had on \nWhen he th' ambitious Norway combated. \nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, \nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \n'Tis strange.\n \nMarcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n \nHoratio. In what particular thought to work I know not; \nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion, \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n \nMarcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue.

It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\n \nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n \n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love some­thing more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\n \nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n \n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\n \nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n \n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\n \nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\n \nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\n \nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bot­tom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was noth­ing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been call­ing to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\n \nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n \n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\n \nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.",

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\n \nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n \n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\n \nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\n \nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n \n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n \n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his ci­gar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n \n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n \n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\n \nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n \n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to ex­plain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\n***\n \nPart 2\n \nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little is­land of black coral.\n \n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n \n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\n \nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n \n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n \n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n ‘What should we do?’\n \n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n \n‘But here, why does it come here’\n \nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n \n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind.

	"Text": "The man walked down the trail on a cold, gray day. Pure white snow and ice covered the Earth for as far as he could see. This was his first winter in Alaska. He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\n \nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o’clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\n \nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\n \nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\n \nAs he walked, he looked carefully at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\n \nAt about twelve o’clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand. He opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\n \nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\n \nA half hour later, it happened. At a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man’s feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his clothes and boots.\n \nHe walked over to some small trees. They were covered with snow. In their branches were pieces of dry grass and wood left by flood waters earlier in the year. He put several large pieces of wood on the snow, under one of the trees. On top of the wood, he put some grass and dry branches. He pulled off his gloves, took out his matches, and lighted the fire. He fed the young flame with more wood. As the fire grew , he gave it larger pieces of wood.\n \nHe worked slowly and carefully. At sixty degrees below zero, a man with wet feet must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire. While he was walking, his blood had kept all parts of his body warm. Now that he had stopped, cold was forcing his blood to withdraw deeper into his body. His wet feet had frozen. He could not feel his fingers. His nose was frozen, too. The skin all over his body felt cold.\n \nNow, however, his fire was beginning to burn more strongly. He was safe. He sat under the tree and thought of the old men in Fairbanks.\n \nYet here he was. He had had an accident. He was alone. And he had saved himself. He had built a fire.\n \nThose old men were weak, he thought. A real man could travel alone. If a man stayed calm, he would be all right. The man’s boots were covered with ice. The strings on his boots were as hard as steel. He would have to cut them with his knife.\n \nHe leaned back against the tree to take out his knife. Suddenly, without warning, a heavy mass of snow dropped down. His movement had shaken the young tree only a tiny bit. But it was enough to cause the branches of the tree to drop their heavy load. The man was shocked. He sat and looked at the place where the fire had been.\n \nThe old men had been right, he thought. If he had another man with him, he would not be in any danger now. The other man could build the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire again. This time, he must not fail.\n \nThe man collected more wood. He reached into his pocket for the matches. But his fingers were frozen. He could not hold them. He began to hit his hands with all his force against his legs.\n \nAfter a while, feeling came back to his fingers. The man reached again into his pocket for the matches. But the tremendous cold quickly drove the life out of his fingers. All the matches fell onto the snow. He tried to pick one up, but failed.\n \nThe man pulled on his glove and again beat his hand against his leg. Then he took the gloves off both hands and picked up all the matches. He gathered them together. Holding them with both hands, he scratched the matches along his leg. They immediately caught fire.\n \nHe held the blazing matches to a piece of wood. After a while, he became aware that he could smell his hands burning. Then he began to feel the pain. He opened his hands, and the blazing matches fell on to the snow. The flame went out in a puff of gray smoke.\n \nThe man looked up. The dog was still watching him. The man got an idea. He would kill the dog and bury his hands inside its warm body. When the feeling came back to his fingers, he could build another fire. He called to the dog. The dog heard danger in the man’s voice. It backed away.\n \nThe man called again. This time the dog came closer. The man reached for his knife. But he had forgotten that he could not bend his fingers. He could not kill the dog, because he could not hold his knife.\n \nThe fear of death came over the man. He jumped up and began to run. The running began to make him feel better. Maybe running would make his feet warm. If he ran far enough, he would reach his friends at Henderson Creek. They would take care of him.\n \nIt felt strange to run and not feel his feet when they hit the ground. He fell several times. He decided to rest a while. As he lay in the snow, he noticed that he was not shaking. He could not feel his nose or fingers or feet. Yet, he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He realized he was going to die.\n \nWell, he decided, he might as well take it like a man. There were worse ways to die.\n \nThe man closed his eyes and floated into the most comfortable sleep he had ever known.\n \nThe dog sat facing him, waiting. Finally, the dog moved closer to the man and caught the smell of death. The animal threw back its head. It let out a long, soft cry to the cold stars in the black sky.\n \nAnd then it tuned and ran toward Henderson Creek…where it knew there was food and a fire.",

	"Text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n \nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n \nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n \nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n \nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!",

Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land, \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week. \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day? \nWho is't that can inform me?\n \nHoratio. That can I. \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

Our last king, \nWhose image even but now appear'd to us, \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet \n(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, \nWell ratified by law and heraldry, \nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; \nAgainst the which a moiety competent \nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras, \nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd, \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full, \nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, \nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise \nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other, \nAs it doth well appear unto our state, \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand \nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost; and this, I take it, \nIs the main motive of our preparations, \nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head \nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\n \nBernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!\n \nMarcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\n \nHoratio. Do, if it will not stand.\n \nBernardo. 'Tis here!\n \nHoratio. 'Tis here!\n \nMarcellus. 'Tis gone! \n \n[Exit Ghost.]\n \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical, \nTo offer it the show of violence; \nFor it is as the air, invulnerable, \nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n \nBernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\n \nHoratio. And then it started, like a guilty thing \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein \nThis present object made probation.\n \nMarcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that season comes \nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long; \nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, \nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n \nHoratio. So have I heard and do in part believe it. \nBut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt.",

I think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure \nComes armed through our watch, so like the King \nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n \nHoratio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; \nAs stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events, \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated \nUnto our climature and countrymen. \n \n[Enter Ghost again.] \n \nBut soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! \nI'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!\n \n[Spreads his arms.] \n \nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \nSpeak to me. \nIf there be any good thing to be done, \nThat may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,\nSpeak to me. \nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate, \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid, \nO, speak! \nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth \n(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), \n \n[The cock crows.] \n \nSpeak of it!

	"Text": "Part 1\n \nTwo young women, Sue and Johnsy, lived in New York. They were artists. Johnsy’s real name was Joanna.\n \nIn November it was very cold and Johnsy fell ill. She had a pneumonia, a decease that killed many people.\n \nJohnsy lay on her bed and looked through the small window. She could see only the brick wall of the house next to her building.\n \nIn the morning a doctor examined Johnsy and took her temperature. Then he spoke with Sue in another room.\n \n«Your friend thinks that she is not going to get well. That’s why she has very few chances. I can’t help her. When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",

When my patient loses hope, medicines don’t work.»\n \nAfter the doctor left, Sue cried. Then she put on a cheerful smile and went to Johnsy’s.\n \nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue went up to her bed.\n \nJohnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting: «twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight…\n \nSue looked out the window, too. What was there to count? There was only the wall of the house seven meters away. An old ivy vine climbed up the wall. Its almost bare branches hung on the bricks.\n \n«What is it, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Six,» said Johnsy, quietly. «They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.»\n \n«Five what, dear?» asked Sue.\n \n«Leaves. On the plant. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Didn’t the doctor tell you?»\n \n«Oh, I never heard of such a thing,» said Sue. «Don’t be silly. The doctor told me this morning that you were getting better. Your chances are ten to one! Try to eat some soup now, please..»\n \nJohnsy  kept looking out the window. «There goes another one. No, I don’t want any soup. There were just four leaves left. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I’ll go, too.»\n \n«Johnsy, dear,» said Sue, «promise me not to look out the window for a while. I must finish my drawing by tomorrow.»\n \nJohnsy closed her eyes. She lay white and still. «I want to see the last leaf fall. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of thinking. I want to fall down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.»\n \n«Try to sleep until I come back,» said Sue. «I must call Mister Behrman to be my model for my drawing.»\n***\n \nPart 2\nOld Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the same building. Behrman was a failure in art. He earned a little money being a model to artists.\n \nSue found Behrman in his room. He was sitting and looking at a blank canvas in front of him.  Sue told him about Johnsy.\n \n«She is very sick and weak,» said Sue, «and her mind is full of strange ideas. She thinks that she will die when the last leaf falls.»\n \n«What a foolishness! To die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly idea come in her head?» cried old Behrman.\n \nJohnsy was sleeping when they came. They looked out the window at the ivy vine. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. Then Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. They looked at each other without speaking.\n \nThe next morning Sue found Johnsy with wide-open eyes, looking at the covered window.\n \n«Pull up the shade; I want to see,» she said, quietly.\n \nSue obeyed.\n \nThe rain and strong wind that blew through the night but there was one ivy leaf left. It was the last leaf on the vine. It hung bravely on the branch about seven meters above the ground, still dark green at the center and yellow at its sides.\n \n«It is the last one,» said Johnsy. «I thought it would fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.»\n \n«Dear, dear! Think of me, if you don’t think of yourself. What will I do?»\n \nBut Johnsy did not answer.\n \nThe next morning Johnsy looked at the window but the ivy leaf was still there. She lay for a long time, looking at it. Then she called Sue, who was cooking chicken soup.\n \n«I’ve been a bad girl,» said Johnsy. » It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.»\n \nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hall.\n \n«She is better,» said the doctor. «With good care, you’ll win. And now I must see another patient, I have in your building. Behrman, an artist.  He had a pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him.»\n \nLater that day, Sue came up to the bed where Johnsy lay, and said to her.\n \n«I have something to tell you, dear,» she said. «Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today. He was sick only two days.  They found him last morning in his room. His shoes and clothes were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.\n \nAnd then they found a lantern and a ladder. And paints and brushes, and a painting board with green and yellow colors mixed on it.\n \nLook out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn’t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman’s masterpiece – he painted it that night when the last leaf fell.»",
